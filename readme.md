# TributeLoot

TributeLoot is a World of Warcraft mod that links raid boss loot, players then whisper the mod if they are interested in winning an item. The mod silently records the information and then prints the results in chat afterwards.

This mod has been deprecated with "Master Loot" being replaced by "Personal Loot" in patch 8.0 and is no longer maintained.
